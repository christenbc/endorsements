# KAPTUE & DESTINNO
>“I have had the opportunity to collaborate professionally with Christen in the architecture design and implementation of a cross-platform application with Flutter, and the experience has been very good.

>From the beginning he empathized with the project, trying to capture the global vision and understand all the functional details of the project with the objective of closing a functional document to start working with. During the project, he has been very autonomous and has defined technical solutions to the different challenges that were appearing, explaining in a simple way the different solution approaches.

>He has been very agile in correcting bugs after the different acceptance tests of the application and has carried out all the publication in the markets successfully. I would like to highlight his commitment and involvement throughout the project, and I am sure I will count on him for new developments.”
